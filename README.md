# browser-in-c
This project implements a complete browser simulation in C, featuring tab management, navigation history, and page loading functionality. The browser maintains multiple tabs organized in a circular doubly-linked list with a sentinel node, with each tab containing its own navigation stacks (BACKWARD and FORWARD) for history tracking.
